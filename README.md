### Vehicle Detection, Tracking, and Counting
This project uses YOLOv8 and DeepSORT to detect, track, and count vehicles in real-time from video footage. It provides lane-specific vehicle counts and displays total vehicle counts directly on the output video.
#### Features
Real-Time Vehicle Detection: Powered by YOLOv8 for accurate object detection.
Robust Tracking: DeepSORT for tracking vehicles across frames.
Lane-Based Counting: Counts vehicles in specific lanes and calculates the total.
Video Annotation: Annotates frames with lane boundaries, vehicle IDs, and counts.
#### Requirements
Python 3.8+,
YOLOv8,
OpenCV,
NumPy,
PyTorch,
DeepSORT
